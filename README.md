# Generate Code from UI

This Streamlit app is designed to convert UI designs into code using the power of AI. It analyzes uploaded images of UI designs and generates corresponding HTML code, making it easier for developers to bring their designs to life.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the App

To run the app, use the following command:

```
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

## Configuration

Before running the app, you may configure your own API key in the `app.py` file. Replace the `API_KEY` variable with your own Gemini API key and also configure the model name to best fit your results with your expectations.

You can also tell Gemini to use a specific CSS framework, like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS!
